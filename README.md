# 🌩️ Cloud Resource Analyzer – Turning AWS Data into Cost Savings 🌩️  

Managing cloud resources is powerful, but it’s also costly when instances and storage are left idle.  
To tackle this, I built a **Cloud Resource Analyzer & Visualization Dashboard** that automatically scans AWS accounts, identifies underutilized resources, and highlights opportunities to **cut unnecessary cloud spend**.  

---

## 🔧 What I built
- Automated **AWS resource scanner** (EC2, RDS, S3) using **Python + Boto3**  
- Intelligent detection of idle/underused resources with **cost & savings calculation**  
- **Streamlit-powered dashboard** for executives & engineers:  
  - 📊 Cost distribution by service  
  - 💰 Potential monthly savings  
  - 🔎 Drill-down views to prioritize high-cost resources  
- **CSV reporting** for easy export and tracking

## 🚀 Why it matters
This project isn’t just a demo — it solves a **real business problem**.  
Cloud costs are a major challenge for organizations, and this tool shows how automation + visibility = **direct cost optimization**.

## 💡 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Boto3  
- Pandas  
- Streamlit  
- AWS CloudWatch  

---

## ✨ Next Steps
- Add scheduled scans via **AWS Lambda**  
- Build enterprise-ready dashboards with **Amazon QuickSight / Grafana**  

---

## ⚡ Impact
With this solution, companies can save on cloud bills, while I demonstrated my skills in **Cloud Engineering, DevOps, and FinOps (Cloud Cost Management)**.
